Cloud computing has become a key infrastructure in information technology due to its ability to provide scalable and elastic resources on demand. This capability is supported by virtualization, which enables resource rental without direct management by users while also improving efficiency and sustainability of data centers. One of the main challenges in cloud computing is the placement of virtual machines (VMs) on physical machines (PMs) and traffic engineering in data center networks, which must consider various operational efficiency factors, such as energy consumption and resource utilization, as well as Quality of Service (QoS) aspects, such as bandwidth allocation and communication latency between VMs. 

VM placement and network routing optimization becomes increasingly complex due to conflicting constraints, making multiobjective optimization methods suitable for solving this problem. On the top of that, this problem is NP-complete, making heuristic algorithms more suitable than exact algorithms. This study employs NSGA-III (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III), a genetic algorithm for solving multi-objective problems, aiming to optimize energy consumption, resource efficiency in VM placement, bandwidth allocation, and communication latency in network routing simultaneously.

The performance of NSGA-III is evaluated through simulations using CloudSim Plus, considering various scenarios such as network topology, VM resource demands, PM capacity, and NSGA-III parameters. The performance of NSGA-III is measured using several metrics, including hypervolume and the average intergenerational distance. Additionally, the solutions obtained by NSGA-III are compared with exact solutions obtained from linear programming (LP) solvers and several heuristic algorithm combinations for VM placement and routing.
